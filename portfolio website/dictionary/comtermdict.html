		<h2>Computer Terminologies </h2>

		<h3>Adobe Acrobat Reader</h3>
		<p>Acrobat Reader is software that allows you to view a PDF document (a document that can be seen but not changed). It can be downloaded free of charge from Adobe.</p>

		<h3>ADSL</h3>
		<p>Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) is a type of digital subscriber line (DSL) broadband technology that is used to connect to the Internet. It uses standard telephone lines to deliver high-speed data communications (up to 24 megabytes per second).</p>

		<h3>Analogue</h3>
		<p>Analogue is a conventional method of transmitting data. Standard landline telephones use analogue technology. It is distinct from digital technology, which provides for greater quality and speed of data transmission.</p>
		
		<h3>Assistive technology</h3>
		<p>Assistive technology refers to any software or hardware that acts to assist and improve the functional capabilities of people with disabilities. Examples include wheelchairs, prosthetics, voice-to-text technology and text-to-speech technology</p>

		<h3>Attachment</h3>
		<p>An attachment is a document sent with an email message. Many types of files can be sent this way (e.g. Word documents, PDFs, Excel files, JPEGs). Be wary of attaching large files because these can take a lot of time for the recipient to download. If you have a large file, it is considered good practice to compress the file using software such as Winzip before attaching it</p>

		<h3>Back-end</h3>
		<p>Back-end refers to the part of an application that performs an essential task not apparent to the user.</p>
		<h3>Backward compatible</h3>
		<p>If software is backward compatible, it is compatible with earlier (superseded) versions of the same software. For example, the Microsoft word-processing program Word 2010 can read files created in the 2003 version of the same program, so it is backward compatible.</p>

		<h3>Bandwidth</h3>
		<p>Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data that can travel a communications path in a given time, usually measured in seconds.</p>

		<h3>Bit</h3>
		<p>A bit (short for binary digit) is the smallest unit of measurement in computing. 8 bits make up 1 byte.</p>
		<h3>Bluetooth</h3>
		<p>Bluetooth is a wireless communications technology intended to replace cables. It allows short-range connections between two or more Bluetooth-compatible devices such as mobile phones, tablets, headsets or medical equipment</p>

		<h3>Bookmark</h3>
		<p>A bookmark is a saved link to a particular Web page. Microsoft Internet Explorer denotes bookmarks as "favourites."</p>

		<h3>Broadband</h3>
		<p>Broadband is a type of communications technology whereby a single wire can carry more than one type of signal at once; for example, audio and video. Cable TV is one technology that uses broadband data transmission.</p>
		<h3>Browser</h3>
		<p>A software program that allows you to surf the web. Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.</p>

		<h3>Cache	</h3>
		<p>When you download (read) a web page, the data is "cached," meaning it is temporarily stored on your computer.</p>

		<h3>CAD</h3>
		<p>Computer-aided design (CAD) is a type of software that allows users to create 2D and 3D design and modelling. CAD is used by architects, engineers, artists and other professionals to create precise technical drawings.</p>
		<h3>Chip</h3>
		<p>A chip is a microprocessor that performs many functions and calculations that make your computer run. Your computer's chip is also referred to as the CPU (Central Processing Unit) or the processor.</p>

		<h3>Cloud computing</h3>
		<p>Cloud computing refers to the storing and accessing of data and programs over the Internet instead of on another type of hard drive. Examples of Cloud services include iCloud, Google Cloud and Dropbox.</p>

		<h3>Cookie</h3>
		<p>A piece of code or data created by a web server and stored on a user's computer. It is used to keep track of the user's usage patterns and preferences.</p>
		<h3>CPU</h3>
		<p>The central processing unit (CPU) is the brains behind your computer. The CPU is responsible for performing calculations and tasks that make programs work. The higher the speed of a CPU, the faster the CPU undertakes the calculations and tasks.</p>

		<h3>Device driver</h3>
		<p>A device driver is a small program that allows a peripheral device such as a printer or scanner to connect to your PC.</p>

		<h3>Domain</h3>
		<p>A domain is a set of computers on a network that are managed as a unit.</p>
		<h3>Encryption</h3>
		<p>Encryption is the process of converting electronic data to an unrecognisable or encrypted form, one that cannot be easily understood by unauthorised parties.</p>

		<h3>Ethernet</h3>
		<p>Ethernet is the most common way of connecting computers on a network with a wired connection. It is a type of local area network (LAN) technology, providing a simple interface for connecting multiple devices.</p>

		<h3>Gateway</h3>
		<p>A point within a network that interconnects with other networks.</p>
		<h3>Hard disk</h3>
		<p>The physical place where a computer stores information - applications and files - is known as its hard disk drive (HDD). The bigger the HDD, the more data it can store.</p>
		<h3>HTML</h3>
		<p>Hyper-text markup language (HTML) is a set of symbols inserted into files intended for display on the world wide web. The symbols tell web browsers how to display words and images - e.g. which colour, font and type size to use - and they direct it to link to other pages on the world wide web via hyperlinks.</p>

		<h3>Internet</h3>
		<p>A set of interconnected networks that allow computers in different locations to exchange information. The Internet includes services such as the world wide web, electronic mail, file transfer protocol (FTP), chat and remote access to networks and computers.</p>

		<h3>LAN</h3>
		<p>A local area network (LAN) is a system that connects computers and other devices that share a common communications line and wireless link, generally within a limited geographical area such as a home or office building.</p>
		<h3>Malware</h3>
		<p>"Malware" is short for malicious software. It refers to a software program that has been developed to do harm to other computers. Types of malware include viruses, worms and spyware.</p>

		<h3>Megabyte</h3>
		<p>A measure of computer processor storage and real and virtual memory. A megabyte (Mb) is 2 to the 20th power bytes, or 1,048,576 bytes in decimal notation.</p>

		<h3>Operating system</h3>
		<p>An operating system (OS) is the software that manages all of a computer's processes and allows programs and applications to run. The most prominent operating system is Microsoft Windows. Others include Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
		<h3>Processor</h3>
		<p>The processor is the brains of your computer. It is responsible for performing calculations and tasks that make programs work. The faster the processor, the faster the computer works.</p>

		<h3>RAM</h3>
		<p>Random access memory (RAM) is usually referred to as a computer's "memory" - it stores information used by programs. Generally, the larger your computer's RAM, the more programs it can run at once without slowing down.</p>

		<h3>ROM</h3>
		<p>ROM stands for read-only memory. It is the part of a computer's memory that cannot be changed by a user. The contents of ROM remain even when the computer is turned off</p>

		<h3>Server</h3>
		<p>A server is a computer that handles requests for data, email, file transfers, and other network services from other computers.</p>

		<h3>URL</h3>
		<p>A URL (unique resource locator) or web address is the string of characters you type into a browser to access a particular website or other resource on the Internet. (eg. http://www.ourcommunity.com.au )</p>

		<h3>Virus</h3>
		<p>A virus is a piece of programming code inserted into other programming to cause damage. Viruses can be sent in many forms but are often transmitted via email messages that, when opened, may erase data or cause damage to your hard disk. Some viruses are able to enter your email system and send themselves to other people in your list of contacts</p>

		<h3>Wi-Fi</h3>
		<p>Wi-Fi is a technology that allows computers and other devices to communicate via a wireless signal. Essentially, it means you can browse the internet without tripping over phone cords</p>

		<h3>Zip</h3>
		<p>To zip files is to archive and compress them into one file of smaller size using a program such as WinZip. It's a handy way to make files smaller before sending them via email</p>
